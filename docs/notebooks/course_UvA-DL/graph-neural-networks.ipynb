    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained increasing popularity in both applications and research,\n",
    "including domains such as social networks, knowledge graphs, recommender systems, and bioinformatics.\n",
    "While the theory and math behind GNNs might first seem complicated,\n",
    "the implementation of those models is quite simple and helps in understanding the methodology.\n",
    "Therefore, we will discuss the implementation of basic network layers of a GNN,\n",
    "namely graph convolutions, and attention layers.\n",
    "Finally, we will apply a GNN on semi-supervised node classification and molecule categorization.\n",

    "### Graph representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the discussion of specific neural network operations on graphs, we should consider how to represent a graph.\n",
    "Mathematically, a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is defined as a tuple of a set of nodes/vertices $V$, and a set of edges/links $E$: $\\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$.\n",
    "Each edge is a pair of two vertices, and represents a connection between them.\n",
    "For instance, let's look at the following graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-tutorials/raw/main/course_UvA-DL/graph-neural-networks/example_graph.svg\" width=\"250px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertices are $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and edges $E=\\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)\\}$.\n",
    "Note that for simplicity, we assume the graph to be undirected and hence don't add mirrored pairs like $(2,1)$.\n",
    "In application, vertices and edge can often have specific attributes, and edges can even be directed.\n",
    "The question is how we could represent this diversity in an efficient way for matrix operations.\n",
    "Usually, for the edges, we decide between two variants: an adjacency matrix, or a list of paired vertex indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **adjacency matrix** $A$ is a square matrix whose elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent,\n",
    "i.e. connected, or not.\n",
    "In the simplest case, $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a connection from node $i$ to $j$, and otherwise 0.\n",
    "If we have edge attributes or different categories of edges in a graph, this information can be added to the matrix as well.\n",
    "For an undirected graph, keep in mind that $A$ is a symmetric matrix ($A_{ij}=A_{ji}$).\n",
    "For the example graph above, we have the following adjacency matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "    1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n",
    "    0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
    "    0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While expressing a graph as a list of edges is more efficient in terms of memory and (possibly) computation,\n",
    "using an adjacency matrix is more intuitive and simpler to implement.\n",
    "In our implementations below, we will rely on the adjacency matrix to keep the code simple.\n",
    "However, common libraries use edge lists, which we will discuss later more.\n",
    "Alternatively, we could also use the list of edges to define a sparse adjacency matrix with which we can work\n",
    "as if it was a dense matrix, but allows more memory-efficient operations.\n",
    "PyTorch supports this with the sub-package `torch.sparse`\n",
    "([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html)) which is however still in a beta-stage\n",
    "(API might change in future)."

    "### Graph Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Convolutional Networks have been introduced by [Kipf et al. ](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl)\n",
    "in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam.\n",
    "He also wrote a great [blog post](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) about this topic,\n",
    "which is recommended if you want to read about GCNs from a different perspective.\n",
    "GCNs are similar to convolutions in images in the sense that the \"filter\" parameters are typically shared over all locations in the graph.\n",
    "At the same time, GCNs rely on message passing methods, which means that vertices exchange information with the neighbors,\n",
    "and send \"messages\" to each other.\n",
    "Before looking at the math, we can try to visually understand how GCNs work.\n",
    "The first step is that each node creates a feature vector that represents the message it wants to send to all its neighbors.\n",
    "In the second step, the messages are sent to the neighbors, so that a node receives one message per adjacent node.\n",
    "Below we have visualized the two steps for our example graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-tutorials/raw/main/course_UvA-DL/graph-neural-networks/graph_message_passing.svg\" width=\"700px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to formulate that in more mathematical terms, we need to first decide how to combine\n",
    "all the messages a node receives.\n",
    "As the number of messages vary across nodes, we need an operation that works for any number.\n",
    "Hence, the usual way to go is to sum or take the mean.\n",
    "Given the previous features of nodes $H^{(l)}$, the GCN layer is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H^{(l+1)} = \\sigma\\left(\\hat{D}^{-1/2}\\hat{A}\\hat{D}^{-1/2}H^{(l)}W^{(l)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$W^{(l)}$ is the weight parameters with which we transform the input features into messages ($H^{(l)}W^{(l)}$).\n",
    "To the adjacency matrix $A$ we add the identity matrix so that each node sends its own message also to itself:\n",
    "$\\hat{A}=A+I$.\n",
    "Finally, to take the average instead of summing, we calculate the matrix $\\hat{D}$ which is a diagonal\n",
    "matrix with $D_{ii}$ denoting the number of neighbors node $i$ has.\n",
    "$\\sigma$ represents an arbitrary activation function, and not necessarily the sigmoid (usually a ReLU-based\n",
    "activation function is used in GNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing the GCN layer in PyTorch, we can take advantage of the flexible operations on tensors.\n",
    "Instead of defining a matrix $\\hat{D}$, we can simply divide the summed messages by the number of neighbors afterward.\n",
    "Additionally, we replace the weight matrix with a linear layer, which additionally allows us to add a bias.\n",
    "Written as a PyTorch module, the GCN layer is defined as follows:"
